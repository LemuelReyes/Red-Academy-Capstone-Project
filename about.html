  <p>Navigating through Canada's immigration website alone can make a person
overwhelmed and discouraged. <br /> It's understandable; Canada has a complex
immigration system with a constant changing of policies and requirements every
year. <br />Countless of forms to fill out, specific documents to process, and the
unending workload can cause a person to feel flustered, make mistakes, waste
time and energy.
